# FixFD_v2
Updated version of fixfd || Testing Phase

This project is the updated second version of FixFD, which was previously a complete server-side application. Though the previous version serves the purpose, it also hinders the scaling of applilcation. This version is therefore an upgrade of architecture to client-side application along with some major UI-UX enhancements and refactored code.

All is being acheived by deploying APIs(a pre-requisite for mobile app) on node server and serving static file via nginx.
